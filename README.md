# GPIO Toggle CLI App

Hello sir,
This is a simple command-line app written in C that simulates GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) toggling. It was built as part of a task assigned.

##  What This App Does

This tool mimics a basic GPIO toggle operation using the terminal.

You can:

- Start the toggling (prints "ON"/"OFF" every second for 10 seconds)
- Check the current toggle **status** at any time
- Stop the toggling process gracefully (sets status to IDLE)

##  How to Build

Make sure you have `gcc` installed (most Linux setups like WSL do). Then just run:

```bash
make
